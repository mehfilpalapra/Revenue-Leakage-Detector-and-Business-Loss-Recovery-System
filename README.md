# Revenue Leakage Detector and Business Loss Recovery System

## Overview
This end-to-end project tackles a real-world business challenge: identifying and reducing revenue leakage in organizations using AI-powered analytics.

Revenue leakage is the loss of revenue due to process gaps, billing errors, fraud, or inefficiencies. Many companies face these issues unknowingly. This system helps detect such losses early and recommends areas for recovery.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Data cleaning, EDA, machine learning
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard with KPIs, slicers, and DAX insights
- **Excel**: Pre-analysis, modeling, and financial structure prep
- **SQL (optional)**: For scalable integration in business systems

## Problem Statement
Many businesses suffer from silent revenue loss caused by:
- Pricing inconsistencies
- Delayed or missed billing
- Product-level margin drops
- Unmonitored credit limits
- Operational inefficiencies

This leads to a direct hit on profit margins, financial forecasting, and customer trust.

## Solution
We built a system that:
1. **Identifies root causes** of revenue leakage
2. **Predicts future risk zones** using historical data
3. **Provides a dashboard** to help business leaders monitor key loss drivers
4. **Recommends actions** to improve billing accuracy, pricing logic, and margin control

## Key Features
- AI-based detection of revenue loss patterns
- Visual insights into loss segments (product, region, category)
- Forecasting of high-risk areas
- Business recovery suggestions powered by data

## AI/ML Implementation
- Classification and regression models to detect loss-prone entities
- Pattern discovery for operational leakages
- Predictive scoring to flag risky transactions

## Power BI Dashboard
Includes:
- KPIs: Total Revenue, Lost Revenue, Net Recovery Potential
- Visuals: Line charts, bar graphs, category-wise drill-downs
- Slicers: Region, Product, Quarter, Leakage Source
- DAX Measures for dynamic insights
