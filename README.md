# Revenue Leakage Detector and Business Loss Recovery System

This project is designed to solve a common but overlooked business problem: **revenue leakage**. Using Power BI, Excel, Python, and SQL, this system identifies, analyzes, and helps recover lost revenue by exposing business gaps, inefficiencies, and hidden risks.

---

## Problem

In many growing businesses, revenue loss often happens silently due to poor tracking, delayed actions, inefficient processes, or data blind spots. These leakages can accumulate over time and impact profitability and growth without any clear signal.

There is usually no dedicated system that flags early signs of revenue loss or predicts high-risk areas across business functions like sales, operations, or customer service.

---

## Solution

This project builds a data-driven, AI-assisted analysis system that detects the root causes of revenue loss and enables preventive and corrective decision-making.

Key highlights:

- **Power BI Dashboard** to monitor revenue trends, loss categories, KPIs, and risky patterns.
- **Role-Level Security (RLS)** applied using Power BI to ensure secure access based on department roles.
- **SQL + Python** used for preprocessing, cleaning, EDA, and predictive logic.
- **Excel** used as a structured input source, simulating real-world enterprise data flows.

The dashboard focuses on simplicity, speed, and insight clarity. All visuals are built using standard Power BI Desktop without external visuals. WordClouds were removed from the main dashboard for visual clarity but are documented in the GitHub repository.

## Key Features

- Real-time Revenue Loss Categories
- Risk-Based KPIs (high loss segments, channels, departments)
- Historical Trends vs Forecast Gaps
- Recovery Opportunity Zones
- Dynamic Filters and Drill-throughs
- DAX measures for comparative analysis
- Role-Level Security (RLS) based on region and department

---

## Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** (for visualization and RLS setup)
- **Excel** (for structured business data input)
- **SQL** (for relational data queries and joins)
- **Python** (for exploratory data analysis and AI forecasting logic)

---

## AI Element (Future Expansion)

In the next phase, this system will include a **machine learning model** that flags high-risk business units or regions based on historical patterns. This will assist decision-makers in prioritizing actions and allocating recovery resources more effectively.

---

## Project Goal

The goal is not just to visualize business data, but to help detect revenue loss **before it becomes a business risk**. This project can be adapted across industries like retail, telecom, logistics, or healthcare.
